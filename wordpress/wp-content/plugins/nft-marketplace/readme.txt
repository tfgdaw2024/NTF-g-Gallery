NFT Marketplace helps you mint and sell NFTs on your WordPress site and earn royalties out of them after reselling. 

== Description ==
By incorporating the **[[NFT Marketplace and Loyalty Rewards](https://plugins.miniorange.com/wordpress-nft-marketplace-creator-wp-nft-maker)]**, your WordPress site transforms into an **[[NFT marketplace](https://plugins.miniorange.com/nft-marketplace-for-wordpress)]**, providing users with a shopping experience akin to a regular eCommerce store.

To understand the functionality and flow of our WordPress NFT Marketplace Plugin, please refer to the Setup Guide **[[here](https://plugins.miniorange.com/how-to-setup-wordpress-nft-marketplace)]**.

Customers have the option to buy or create NFTs just like purchasing products from WooCommerce. You can easily deploy new NFT collections on your preferred blockchain or import existing ones, allowing you to earn royalties from the transactions.

The miniOrange WordPress NFT Marketplace is versatile, extending support to various blockchains, including **Ethereum, Solana, Polygon, Binance, Cardano, XRPL, Avalanche and more.**
For assistance with any additional blockchain support, feel free to reach out to us via email at **web3@xecurify.com**.

With this plugin, you can easily create and manage custom NFTs that represent rewards or membership in your loyalty program, track user activity and reward NFTs accordingly, and enable users to exchange NFTs for rewards or other incentives.

The next video is about earning royalties from NFTs and customizing **[[smart contracts](https://plugins.miniorange.com/wordpress-smart-contracts-web3)]** for NFT marketplaces. The process of earning royalties from NFTs involves receiving a percentage of the purchase price each time the NFT is resold. This can be customized through smart contracts to benefit different stakeholders.
